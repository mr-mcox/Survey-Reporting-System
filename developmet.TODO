To implement:
  ✔ Create column and row based headings for each table @done (13-11-15 19:13)
  ☐ Collect all data into a single structure
  ☐ Transform structure into a table and export as excel
Refactor:
  ☐ Survey is indentified on questions table and not on results table
  ☐ Convert keys for CalculationCorinator to set to avoid order issues

Maybe:
  ☐ Import 1314F8W survey data automatically on migration from old DB
  ☐ Add indicies to the DB
  ☐ Add additional columns to substitute for when importing demographic data
  ☐ Change cut by question ID to cut by question code
